**Dive Into Sustainability is a recycling project that I created here at UCSB to help athletes reduce the amount of plastic waste produced in sports!**

## How the Idea Came to Be!

This past year, I served as the Athletics Coordinator for UCSB's Associated Students Zero Waste Committee. It is my job to act as a liason between my committee and the athletics department, ensuring that they are engaging in sustainable practices. My co-coordinator, Camille Mras, and I are both aquatic sport athletes- I swim, and she plays water polo - and we have seen firsthand how much plastic waste is generated in sports. I can't even count the number of swim suits, caps, goggles, fins, and paddles that I've gone through over my career as a swimmer, so we decided we wanted to help make sports more sustainable by recycling and repurposing old aquatic sports gear. We created a partnership with UCSB Recreation and TerraCycle, a recycling company, and we have seen lots of success so far!

# Current Project Scale and How it Works!

For our project, we are utilizing the Sporting Goods Zero Waste Boxes from TerraCycle. We place the collection box in the lobby of the Recreation Center to collect any sports equipment, gear, and clothing, and once it is full of waste, we ship it back to the company headquarters, where they are able to recycle and repurpose the materials we collect. After processing, we receive an audit that details how much carbon and water was saved from the materials we recycled.

## Future Goals!

Our project was super successful in the first couple of months. The first Zero Waste Box that we placed out for collection filled up completely within 2 weeks! We started our project only collecting materials from aquatic sports, but due to the success of the project, we have now expanded it to collecting material from all sports!

Our goal is that our project will gain lots of momentum and awareness, and can eventually be expanded to all of the UC Campuses, and schools all around the nation!
