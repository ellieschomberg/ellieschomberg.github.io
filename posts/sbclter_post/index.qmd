I work as an intern in the SBC LTER lab, assisting in data collection and analysis for various research projects that examine the long-term effects of human activities on kelp forest ecosystems. I have contributed to both Urchin Settlement and Benthic Competition Experiments, involving tasks such as rinsing and preparing brushes for deployment, splitting samples, and identifying and sorting microscopic invertebrates. Additionally, I program and download data from light and temperature sensors, and utilize RStudio, Excel, and Google Sheets to manage and analyze data for ongoing research projects.
