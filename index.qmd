My name is Ellie Schomberg and I am a third-year student pursuing a B.S. in Environmental Studies at UCSB, specializing in Marine Conservation. I aspire to work on protecting coral reefs and other marine ecosystems in the future. I am also a Division 1 Athlete on the Women's Swim team. In my free time, I love to swim, go to the beach, and do yoga.
