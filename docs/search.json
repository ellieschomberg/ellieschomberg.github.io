    "text": "How the Idea Came to Be!\nThis past year, I served as the Athletics Coordinator for UCSB’s Associated Students Zero Waste Committee. It is my job to act as a liason between my committee and the athletics department, ensuring that they are engaging in sustainable practices. My co-coordinator, Camille Mras, and I are both aquatic sport athletes- I swim, and she plays water polo - and we have seen firsthand how much plastic waste is generated in sports. I can’t even count the number of swim suits, caps, goggles, fins, and paddles that I’ve gone through over my career as a swimmer, so we decided we wanted to help make sports more sustainable by recycling and repurposing old aquatic sports gear. We created a partnership with UCSB Recreation and TerraCycle, a recycling company, and we have seen lots of success so far!"

We started our project only collecting materials from aquatic sports, but due to the success of the project, we have now expanded it to collecting material from all sports!\nOur goal is that our project will gain lots of momentum and awareness, and can eventually be expanded to all of the UC Campuses, and schools all around the nation!"
